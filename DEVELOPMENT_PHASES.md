## **Incremental Development Benefits:**

1. **Early Validation**: Each phase delivers working functionality
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Problems are identified and resolved early
3. **User Feedback**: Can gather feedback after each phase
4. **Flexible Scope**: Can adjust features based on learning
5. **Continuous Deployment**: Each phase can be deployed independently

## **Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for core functions in each phase
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Manual testing for UX validation

This phased approach ensures continuous progress with working software at the end of each week, allowing for early feedback and course corrections.
